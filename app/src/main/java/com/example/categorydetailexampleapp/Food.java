    these final static arrays will represent the data for each category. If we have three
    categories, we will have 3 arrays. Each array can have as many elements as it wants.
    Each element in the category array will contain the data for the specific Food items in this category.

    as a placeholder, if you don't have your images yet, then you can put any integer

    static array means this array belongs to the Food class as a whole, not just to one particular Food item

    because the array is public, we can access it from other Activity files

    final means its values cannot change elsewhere in any other Activity files

    initializing the contents with an initializer list, ex for would be:
    int[] myNums = {1,2,3,4,5}
    String[] myNames = {"Kevin", "Zhou"}

    In this case, the array is of type Food, so we need to call the Food constructor to create new Food
    objects for each element in the array
